## Our Story

###### A little bit about how we met.

One born in Hopkins, Minnesota. The other born in Bre≈æice, Slovenia. As luck would have it, these two would meet because of a simple smile.

Queue the montage with your favorite cheesy love song and imagine two love birds sending emails back and forth. Excitedly checking their email each time their phone buzzed. Sharing their favorite songs, stories, and secrets with each other and Skyping with each other for hours on end.

After countless miles travelled between Des Moines and Minneapolis, we're finally getting married! Join us on July 8th, 2017 for the big day!
